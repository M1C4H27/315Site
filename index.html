        <p class="p">My name is <strong>Micah Nava</strong>. At least that is what I go by. My real name is <em>Miqueas Nava</em> but I do not go by that because that's hard for most people to say. I am from a small town in the state of Oregon. I am currently a Senior here at Liberty University and I am majoring in Computer Science: Cyber Security. Something interesting about me is that I've been trained to play the piano classically and was in lessons for 9 years. I also love football, visit this link to see the latest NFL scores <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/scoreboard" target="_blank">NFL Scores</a>!!</p>
        <p>The website I plan to build this semester is a personal portfolio.</p>
